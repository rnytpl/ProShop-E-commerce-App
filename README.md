This is a project that comes with a course that I purchased on Udemy to create a full stack MERN application.
It is a course from Brad Traversy, a web developer that inspired and helped me to take the decision to become a developer.
To get into the specifics of the project, it makes use of technologies in MERN stack.
I also added Redux on top of that to manage states.
More of the details will be included in this file later.
